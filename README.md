# Prophet Anomaly Detection

Facebook developed an R package called "prophet" that runs on Stan and uses Bayesian techniques for forecasting and changepoint detection. This implementation of this package seeks to make an anomaly detection tool where data can be loaded into the tool and run through the prophet package with a(n even more) convenient wrapper. The data can be passed into the function and then future change points change be analysed.
